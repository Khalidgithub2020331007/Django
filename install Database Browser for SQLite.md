The issue lies in the path provided to the `render` function in your `payments/views.py` file. Specifically:

```python
return render(request, 'templates/payments1.html')
```

The `render` function is looking for a file named `templates/payments1.html`, but that is incorrect. The file `payments1.html` is in the `templates` directory, so you only need to pass the relative path **from the `templates` directory**, not including the `templates` directory itself.

---

### **Correct Code**
Change this line in `payments/views.py`:

```python
return render(request, 'payments1.html')
```

---

### **Why It Happens**
- **The `TEMPLATE_DIR` setting in `settings.py`** (`BASE_DIR/templates`) already tells Django to look inside the `templates` folder. Adding `templates/` in the `render` path causes Django to look for `templates/templates/payments1.html`, which doesn't exist.

---

### **Final Directory Setup**
If `payments1.html` is inside `/templates`, ensure the structure is correct:
```
/home/khalid/Academic/3rd_Year_2nd_Semester/Project_350/resource/back_end/plan60/templates/payments1.html
```

If you're organizing templates by app, place it like this:
```
/home/khalid/Academic/3rd_Year_2nd_Semester/Project_350/resource/back_end/plan60/templates/payments/payments1.html
```
Then, update `views.py` to:
```python
return render(request, 'payments/payments1.html')
```

---

### **Restart the Server**
After making the corrections, restart your development server to ensure the changes take effect:
```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

---

### **Expected Outcome**
Visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8000/pay/tem/` should now correctly render the `payments1.html` template without any `TemplateDoesNotExist` errors.
